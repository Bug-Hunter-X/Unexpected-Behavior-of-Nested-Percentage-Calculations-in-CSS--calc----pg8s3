The solution involves avoiding nested percentage calculations within `calc()` if possible.  A more reliable approach is to calculate the values explicitly using pixel units or pre-calculate the sizes and apply them directly in the CSS. 

Here's a corrected version of the CSS code:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

.inner {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}

.nested {
  width: calc(100% - 20px); /* this calculation should be reliable now*/
  /* Alternatively, you can use a simpler calculation if the context of 100% is not ambiguous:
     width: 100%;
     margin-left: 10px;
     margin-right: 10px; */
}
```

In this improved version, we ensure the context of the `100%` in the `.nested` calculation is clear, leading to the expected layout behavior.
